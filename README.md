# Iris Flowers Classification Based On Machine Learning

## First Of all Downloaded  Iris Flower Dataset  (credits of dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)

### Below are the steps for Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning

1.This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning

2.The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor)

3.These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

4.The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
